Introduction

Predicting CO2 emissions - modelling with linear regression

The CO2 emissions from transport account for approximately a quarter of all CO2 emissions from energy production and of this about half is from cars and buses (https://ourworldindata.org/co2-emissions-from-transport).

The amount of CO2 produced differs for different cars. In this notebook you will explore which features of cars can be used to build a linear model to predict the CO2 emissions.
